Assignments for CSCI 1523, Intro w/ Python
Yo, these are my programs from CSCI 1523, Saint Paul College's Introduction to Computing and Programming Concepts.
Some of these contain exerpts from Warren Sheaffer's Lab Manuals
Others contain exerpts from Dierbach's Introducting to Computer Science with Python
And then there are the weird programs that I wrote!
Don't plagiarize!
